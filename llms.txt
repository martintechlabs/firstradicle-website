# First Radicle

> First Radicle is a high-end software agency that helps startups migrate from no-code platforms (Bubble, Airtable, Webflow) to scalable, production-ready code (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL). We deliver complete migrations in 6 weeks for a fixed $15k price with a money-back guarantee. Our core value proposition: "Stop Building Toys. Start Cultivating Software."

First Radicle specializes in helping non-technical founders who have outgrown their MVP and need to scale beyond the limitations of no-code platforms. We use AI-accelerated development to deliver agency-quality builds at a fraction of the cost, while ensuring clients own 100% of their code and IP.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Fixed-price migrations ($15k for full stack)
- 6-week delivery guarantee
- 100% code ownership (GitHub repository transfer)
- AI-accelerated development with human oversight
- Production-grade tech stack (React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL)

**Tech Stack:**
